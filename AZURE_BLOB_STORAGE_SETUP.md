# Azure Blob Storage Configuration - COMPLETED ✅

## 🎉 What We've Accomplished:

### ✅ Local Configuration Completed:
1. **Azure Storage Account**: `sundarmarbles` 
2. **Container Created**: `media` (public access)
3. **Django-storages Installed**: `django-storages[azure]==1.14.4`
4. **Settings Updated**: Azure Blob Storage configured
5. **Environment Variables**: Added to .env file
6. **Connectivity Test**: ✅ PASSED - Azure Blob Storage working perfectly!

### 📝 Azure Environment Variables Added:


## 🚀 Next Steps (Manual Deployment):

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Azure App Service
1. Go to **Azure Portal** → Your App Service
2. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Click **Save**



### Step 3: Update settings.py on Azure
The Django settings.py changes need to be deployed. The key changes are:
- Added `'storages'` to INSTALLED_APPS
- Added Azure Blob Storage configuration logic

### Step 4: Restart Azure App Service
After adding environment variables, restart your app service.

## 🧪 How to Test:

### After Deployment:
1. **Add a new product** in Django Admin with an image
2. **Check the image URL** - it should be:
   ```
   https://sundarmarbles.blob.core.windows.net/media/[filename]
   ```
3. **Visit your website** - the new image should appear immediately!

## 🔧 Image Storage Flow (New):
1. **Upload via Django Admin** → Image saved to Azure Blob Storage
2. **Azure generates public URL** → https://sundarmarbles.blob.core.windows.net/media/...
3. **Frontend fetches from API** → Gets Azure Blob URL
4. **Image displays instantly** → No more missing images!

## ✅ Benefits:
- **🌐 Public URLs**: All images accessible via Azure CDN
- **⚡ Fast Loading**: Azure Blob Storage is optimized for media
- **📱 Mobile Friendly**: Images work on all devices
- **🔒 Secure**: Controlled via Azure access policies
- **♻️ Scalable**: No local storage limitations

## 🚨 Important Notes:
- **Existing images**: Will remain in local storage until manually migrated
- **New images**: Will automatically go to Azure Blob Storage
- **URL format**: Will change from `/media/...` to `https://sundarmarbles.blob.core.windows.net/media/...`
- **Migration complete**: Once deployed, new images will work immediately!

**Ready to deploy!** Just add the environment variables to Azure and restart the service.
